# ðŸ§º RFM Segmentation for Customer Analytics

This project demonstrates how to apply RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) segmentation to e-commerce customer data to support personalized marketing strategies and improve customer retention.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Business Objective

MetaFlow, a Berlin-based health shake e-commerce company, wants to:
- Identify high-value customers (VIPs)
- Detect churn risks early
- Improve marketing ROI through targeted segmentation

---

## ðŸ“Š What is RFM?

**RFM** is a simple, powerful technique to segment customers based on:
- **Recency**: How recently a customer made a purchase
- **Frequency**: How often they purchase
- **Monetary**: How much money they spend

Each customer receives a score from 1 (lowest) to 4 (highest) in each category. These scores are combined into an RFM Score (e.g., `444`, `231`).

## ðŸ”§ Tools Used

- Python (pandas, matplotlib, seaborn)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Synthetic dataset (`transactions.csv`)

---

## ðŸ§ª Methodology

1. Loaded synthetic transactional data
2. Calculated Recency (days since last purchase), Frequency (number of orders), and Monetary (total spend)
3. Assigned each customer into quartiles per R/F/M dimension
4. Built composite RFM scores and mapped to human-readable segments
5. Visualized customer distribution across segments

## ðŸ“ˆ Customer Segments

| Segment        | Description                              | Example Actions                     |
|----------------|------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| **Champions**  | Recent, frequent, high spenders          | Early access to new products        |
| **Loyal**      | Frequent buyers, moderate spend          | Loyalty rewards program             |
| **New**        | Recent but low activity so far           | Onboarding offers, welcome email    |
| **At Risk**    | High past spenders, but gone quiet       | Win-back campaigns                  |
| **Lost**       | Inactive, low-spending customers         | Remove from paid ads, last promo    |
| **Need Attention** | Average or mixed score customers     | Personalized discounts              |
